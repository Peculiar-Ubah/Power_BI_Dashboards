# My Power BI Dashboard Portfolio

This repository is a collection of Power BI dashboards I've developed. It tracks my journey in using Power BI, from foundational reports to more advanced interactive analyses, all aimed at turning data into clear, actionable insights.

# Featured Dashboards

Explore the dashboards below. Each has its own dedicated README with more details on the build process and specific features.
